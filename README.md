# GIE-metrics

This repository includes Relative Mapping Similarity implementation and scripts for calculating other metrics, like accuracy for Chart Classification.

Files include:

* relative_mapping_similarity.[relative_mapping_similarity.py](./relative_mapping_similarity.py): the iplementation for the algorithm itself.
* [relative_mapping_similarity_test.py](./relative_mapping_similarity_test.py): unit testing for the algorithm.
* [rms_test_tables](./rms_test_tables): directory containing tables in csv format to test the correctness of RMS implementation.
It also include edge cases in order to handle various inputs.
